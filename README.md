# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on features like income, spending score, age, etc., enabling businesses to tailor marketing and sales strategies.

## 🧭 Output & Insights

* Cluster visualizations
* Segmentation into buyer categories like:

  * High-income, high-spending customers
  * Low-income, low-spending customers
  * Moderate spenders, potential customers
* Helps businesses make data-driven marketing decisions

---

## ❗ Notes

* Results depend heavily on data preprocessing and feature selection
* K-Means works best with numerical data
* For non-spherical clusters, try DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Add silhouette analysis
* Deploy segmentation using Streamlit
* Add advanced clustering algorithms
* Build an automated EDA pipeline
